BibManFunctionality.

This is a library of interfaces for BibTeXtoHtmlConverter.

This interfaces are necessary for all work classes to import, export and modify bibliographic data with BibTeXtoHtmlConverter.

This is still unfinished.

BibTeXtoHtmlConverter is main part of my engineer's thesis. Current name is linked with my engineer's thesis title("Application to convertion BibTeX bibliographic data to HTML"). I will change it in future for "Bibliographic Converter", because this program could make conversion between diffrent types of bibliographic data and allow to export data to some formats(xml fo example).

Client source code will be avanaible on my GitHub soon(propobly today).

2 written work libraries "BibTeX.dll" and "BibToHtml.dll" will be inlcuded as binaries.

I will make avanaible all source code afrer my graduation if my University won't prohibid me that.
